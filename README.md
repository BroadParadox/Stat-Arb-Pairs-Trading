# Stat-Arb-Pairs-Trading

#### IE612 (Spring 2024) Course Project Group 16


This project report delves into the concept of Statistical Arbitrage (Stat Arb), focusing specifically on pairs trading as an example. Stat Arb strategies exploit mean reversion in share prices or market microstructure anomalies using quantitative analytics and a diversified portfolio. Pairs trading is a market-neutral strategy that identifies and trades two highly correlated stocks based on statistical techniques. When there is a deviation in the price relationship of these stocks, we expect this to mean reverting and buying the under-performing stock and simultaneously selling the outperforming one. If our mean-reversion assumption is valid then prices should converge to the long-term average and trade should benefit.
